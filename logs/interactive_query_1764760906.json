  "answer": "The section for attempt to murder is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, in general legal terms, the attempt to commit murder is often covered under the same provisions that deal with murder and culpable homicide. In many legal codes, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the relevant sections would typically be found in the sections dealing with murder and culpable homicide.\n\nFor specific reference, you may want to look at Section 307 of the IPC, which deals with the punishment for attempt to murder. However, this section is not included in the provided context. \n\nFor a precise citation, please refer to the Indian Penal Code, Section 307.",
