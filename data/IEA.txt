Original:

- Opponent refuses to produce
- Cannot be easily moved
- Public document (certified copy enough)
- Numerous accounts/documents

### Section 65A-65B: Electronic Records (Added 2000)

**Section 65A**: Electronic records admissible like paper
**Section 65B**: Conditions for admissibility:
- Must produce certificate (Section 65B certificate)
- Certificate from person in charge of computer
- Describing computer, how record was produced
- Complex and cumbersome procedure

**Major Issue**: Courts confused about whether certificate always needed

**This confusion led to BSA simplifying electronic evidence**

## Key Legal Principles Under IEA

- Public documents (Section 74-78)
- Previous judgments (Section 40-43)

### 2. Best Evidence Rule (Section 64)
- Original document is best evidence
- Copies only when original unavailable
- Prevents fraud and alteration

### 3. Confession to Police Inadmissible (Section 25-26)
- Protects against torture/coercion
- Only exception: Section 27 (discovery)
- Magistrate confession admissible (Section 28)

### 4. Burden of Proof (Section 101-114)
**Criminal Cases**:
- Prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt
- Accused presumed innocent
- Burden on prosecution throughout

**Civil Cases**:
- Plaintiff proves on balance of probabilities
- Burden may shift to defendant

**Exception Burden** (Section 105):
- If accused claims exception (self-defense, accident)
- Burden to prove exception on accused

### 5. Presumptions (Section 111-114)
**Court Must Presume** (Section 111):
- Judicial acts done regularly
- Official acts done officially

**Court May Presume** (Section 114):
- Documents 30 years old genuine (if from proper custody)
- Judicial proceedings regular
- Common course of business followed

### 6. Expert Evidence (Section 45-51)
- Expert can give opinion on specialized matters
- Court not bound by expert opinion
- Expert's reasoning more important than conclusion

## Electronic Evidence Under IEA

### Section 65A-65B: The Problematic Provisions
Added by IT Act 2000 to deal with computer-generated evidence

**Section 65B Requirements**:
1. Certificate from person in charge of computer
2. Certificate must describe:
   - Computer used
   - How record produced
   - Conditions of computer operation
   - That computer was operating properly
3. Must be signed

**Problems**:
- Too technical and cumbersome
- Courts disagreed on interpretation
- Sometimes impossible to get certificate (email from abroad, etc.)
- Led to years of litigation
- Genuine electronic evidence often rejected

**Famous Case Law**:
- *Anvar P.V. v. P.K. Basheer* (2014): Section 65B certificate mandatory
- *Arjun Panditrao v. Kailash Kushanrao* (2020): Certificate not always needed
- Created confusion and uncertainty

**This led to BSA 2023 removing Section 65B complexity**

## Comparison with BSA

### What IEA Had (Now Changed in BSA)
1. **Section 65B Certificate**: Complex, removed in BSA
2. **Victorian Language**: Hard to understand
3. **Pre-Digital Focus**: Written in 1872, before computers
4. **Rigid Procedures**: Not adaptable to new technology

### What IEA Had (Unchanged in BSA)
1. **Core Principles**: Relevancy, admissibility, burden of proof
2. **Confession Rules**: Police confession inadmissible
3. **Dying Declaration**: Same treatment
4. **Expert Evidence**: Similar provisions
5. **Hearsay Rule**: Retained with exceptions
6. **Best Evidence Rule**: Primary vs secondary

### 2. Electronic Evidence Problems
- Section 65B too complex
- Not suited for digital age
- WhatsApp, email, social media not contemplated
- Certificate requirement impractical

### 3. Not Technology-Neutral
- Specific to physical documents
- Couldn't adapt to blockchain, AI, IoT
- Needed constant amendments

### 4. 150+ Years Old
- Pre-telephone, pre-computer era
- Social and technological changes massive
- Need modern law for modern times
