- Violation of Section 50 can make arrest illegal

## Bail Provisions (Very Restrictive)

### Section 37: Bail
**Conditions for bail**:
1. Public prosecutor must be given opportunity to oppose
2. Court must be satisfied:
   - There are reasonable grounds to believe accused is NOT GUILTY
   - Accused is not likely to commit any offence while on bail
3. For commercial quantity: Bail very difficult, almost never granted
4. Twin conditions must be satisfied

**Practical Effect**: Getting bail in NDPS cases is extremely difficult

## Burden of Proof (Section 35)

**Presumption of Guilt**: If drugs found in possession/on premises
- Accused presumed to be conscious possessor
- Burden shifts to accused to prove innocence
- Reversal of normal criminal law burden

This makes NDPS prosecution easier and defense harder

## Punishment for Death Penalty

### Section 31A: Death Penalty or Life Imprisonment
**For repeat offenders**: If convicted twice under certain sections and commits again:
- Death penalty OR life imprisonment possible
- Applies to serious drug trafficking

1. Medical prescription and use
2. Scientific research
3. Licensed cultivation (poppy, cannabis for medical use)

5. Government-authorized trade

**Requires**: Proper licenses, documentation, government permission

## Rehabilitation and Treatment

### Section 64A: Treatment and Rehabilitation
- First-time offenders (personal consumption)
- Can be sent for medical treatment instead of jail
- Rehabilitation centers for drug addicts

## Forfeiture Provisions

During investigation and proceedings, courts generally don't interfere

## Controlled Delivery Operations

### Section 50A: Controlled Delivery
NCB can allow drug consignment to proceed under surveillance
- To catch entire network

- International cooperation

## Death Penalty vs Life Imprisonment

### When Death Penalty Can Be Given
- Repeat offenders under Section 31A
- Extremely large commercial quantities
- Causing death due to adulterated drugs
- Rare, but legally possible

Most cases: Life imprisonment maximum (10-20 years for commercial quantity)

## Important Case Law Principles
1. Section 50 compliance mandatory for valid search
2. Burden of proof on accused once possession established
3. Conscious possession must be proved
4. Quantity determines punishment
5. Bail extremely difficult in NDPS cases
6. Statements to NCB officers admissible
